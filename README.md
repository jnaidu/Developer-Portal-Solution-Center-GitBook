# Developer Portal Overview
Developer Portal is a single location for everything related to developing applications on the Covisint Cloud Platform.  Its primary functions are divided between the Solution Center, which provides administrative control of the platform, and the Reference Center, which provides reference material for developing on the platform.  The Developer Portal requires an identity realm for managing company and user accounts, so a special administrative realm called the Platform Identity Realm has been created for its use.

# Developer Portal Solution Center
The Solution Center is an application within the Developer Portal that provides administrative control over the platform.  The application is used by both Covisint and external companies that are developing on the platform. It has self-service administrative functions for most of the concepts mentioned in this section.
