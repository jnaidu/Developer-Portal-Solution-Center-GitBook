# Solution Center Roles
The Developer Portal Solution Center has its own set of associated roles, and when a user is granted a role, they gain access to specific features for that application. Each role will be described in detail below, but there are a few general traits shared across roles that are worth noting:

* Multiple roles can be assigned to a single user
    * Example- Roles are cumulative; a single user can be a CCA Security Administrator, a Solution Center Company Administrator, a Solution Center User, and a Messaging Tenant Admin all at the same time.
